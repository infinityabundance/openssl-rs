# Per-file obligation audit — index

**Purpose.** This is the entry point for the `safe-c33` per-file unsafe-site
audit. Each audited file has one record under `per-file/`, named by replacing
`/` with `__` (`src/evp/digest.rs` → `per-file/src__evp__digest.rs.md`). A record
contains the file's complete audit section — candidate identity, group table,
residual register, unclassified operations, highest-risk groups, and any
post-census delta — exactly as it appeared in the former cumulative
`PERFILE-AUDIT.md`.

> **Non-discharge statement.** Every record is a file-level obligation audit,
> **not `SAFETY_DISCHARGED`**. A record enumerates and attributes a file's
> production unsafe sites. It does not establish whole-file safety, does not
> discharge the residual obligations it lists, and is not an
> `INDEPENDENTLY_CHECKED` result. A file graduates only through the AGENTS.md §7
> dependency-closure and independent-evidence gates.

**Campaign progress: 7 of 761 PARTIAL files audited.** The 761 denominator is the
`PARTIAL` file population in `ATTRIBUTION.md`; it is not a count of files that
have graduated. The audits cover 5,338 production unsafe sites in 2,733 groups.

## 1. Reusable template

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `file` | Project-relative source path. |
| `candidate SHA` | The source identity the census was generated from, plus the audit HEAD if they differ. |
| `census counts` | Total operations, production operations, test-only operations, and the file hash from `atlas-refresh/unsafe-census.json`. |
| `group id` | Stable per-file identifier, `D001`-`Dnnn`. |
| `lines` | Every census line in the group, with the group count. |
| `kind` | Census kind code: `UF`, `UB`, `FC`, `HR`, `EC`, `UI`. |
| `ABI/export class` | `safe fn`, `unsafe fn`, or `unsafe extern "C"`, with `exported` or `not exported`. Only an exported FFI entry can carry a caller/ABI precondition. |
| `operation` | The actual raw/FFI operation(s) at those lines. |
| `contract` | The validity contract relied on: SAFETY comment, owner/slot type, FFI ABI, or `CtxDestroy` contract. |
| `establishment` | Who establishes the precondition: this code, an in-file caller, or an external C/ABI/provider contract. |
| `dependency group` | `D###` ids of groups whose obligations this row inherits, or `—` if none. |
| `state` | `CONTRACTED` (contract stated, not established), `ESTABLISHED` (precondition established by code or an identified caller/ABI contract), or `UNATTRIBUTED` (no caller-side establishment or boundary attribution). |
| `evidence needed` | Exactly what would be required before the group can become `INDEPENDENTLY_CHECKED`. |
| `residuals` | Obligations that remain after the group's current contract, including callback reentrancy, raw member pointers, and caller-asserted lengths. |

Group identifiers are per-file (`D###`, `C###`, `CC###`, `K###`, `P###`); the
same identifier can appear in different records for different files. Dependency
references are local to the record's file.

## 2. Lifecycle and state definitions

The state vocabulary maps onto the AGENTS.md §21 lifecycle:

```text
UNKNOWN -> CONTRACTED -> ESTABLISHED -> INDEPENDENTLY_CHECKED -> DISCHARGED
```

- **`CONTRACTED`** — a validity contract is stated, but the precondition is not
  established by this code or by an identified caller/ABI contract. A contract
  comment is not discharge.
- **`ESTABLISHED`** — the precondition is established in code, by an in-file
  caller, by a local owner/type invariant, or by a stated external ABI/provider
  contract. Establishment is not independent verification.
- **`UNATTRIBUTED`** — no caller-side establishment and no boundary attribution
  exists. This includes self-asserted `unsafe impl`/`unsafe trait` destructor
  obligations and safe functions that hide raw-pointer preconditions.
- **`INDEPENDENTLY_CHECKED`** — requires an independent reviewer, exact source
  and build identity, a contract witness per precondition, and a runtime/static
  check that fires on a deliberate violation. **No record claims this state.**
- **`DISCHARGED`** — the AGENTS.md §7 result: every remaining unsafe operation
  has an explicit validity contract, every precondition is established by a
  caller or external ABI contract, and no safe-Rust caller can cause UB through
  the safe interfaces. **No record claims this state.**

The `reviewer` column below records the adversarial-review outcome stated in the
campaign ledger (`PROGRESS.md`, subphases 67–74). A ledger `PASS` is a review of
the audit and its fixes, **not** an `INDEPENDENTLY_CHECKED` result and **not**
`SAFETY_DISCHARGED`.

### Record notes

- The candidate SHA is the `Source SHA-256` recorded in each record's candidate
  identity. The census candidate for all seven is
  `c09eef8b94ce068c92557d9940decf50e8413c8c`; the per-record *audit HEAD* differs
  because the audits landed at different campaign commits. `src/evp/pkey.rs` and
  `src/cms/cms_env.rs` are the files whose audited source differs from the census
  (the `SeamFile` deltas recorded in their §1; `pkey.rs` also has a post-census
  section); their candidate SHA is the audited source.
- `src/evp/digest.rs` carries the reusable template in its record (§1). The
  template is reproduced above so it remains discoverable without reading a
  record.
- `src/provider/cipher.rs` and `src/evp/pkey.rs` include post-census source-delta
  sections. Those sections are part of their records and are not summarized
  away here.
- Counts in this table are transcribed from each record's own "Census totals"
  and "Group state summary"; they are checked against the group rows by
  `PERFILE-INDEX` verification (every row appears exactly once per file).

## 4. Machine-readable index

`atlas-refresh/perfile-index.json` mirrors table 3 as deterministic JSON:

```json
{
  "candidate_head": "d5255e262c602383645fcae2adc43e04faf9d4a3",
  "files": [ ],
  "totals": { "audited": 7, "partial_files": 7, "zero_unsafe": 0, "boundary_covered": 0 }
}
```

`files` is sorted by `file`. `totals.audited` is the number of audited files;
`partial_files`, `zero_unsafe` and `boundary_covered` are their status counts in
the `ATTRIBUTION.md` vocabulary (all seven are `PARTIAL`). Every entry carries
`not_discharged: true`.

## 5. Provenance

The former cumulative `PERFILE-AUDIT.md` was split into these records on
2026-10-18 without editing section content: each record is the corresponding
section verbatim, minus only the inter-section `---` separators and their
surrounding blank padding. The cumulative file is now a pointer to this index so
existing links continue to resolve.
